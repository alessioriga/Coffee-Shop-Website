                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>It all started with a passion for great coffee. After years of searching for the perfect cup,
                            we decided to open Mug and Mingle to share our love for exceptional coffee with others.
                            We believe in sustainability, quality, and craftsmanship, which is why we carefully source
                            our beans from the best farms around the world. Every cup is a reflection of the care and
                            passion we put into brewing the perfect coffee.</p>
